# üåü My Node.js Backend Practice project üåü

Welcome to my Node.js backend project! üöÄ This project is designed to handle all your backend needs with simplicity and efficiency. It uses MongoDB as the database to store and manage data effectively. Below, you'll find everything you need to get started, including the technologies used, how to install the project, and more.

## üì¶ Technologies and Packages Used
This project is built using Node.js and leverages the following npm packages:

ajv: JSON Schema validator.

bcrypt: Library to hash passwords.

config: Configuration management.

cookie-parser: Middleware to parse cookies.

ejs: Embedded JavaScript templating.

express: Web framework for Node.js.

helmet: Security for Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.

jsonwebtoken: For creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool, used to interact with the MongoDB database.

validator: String validation and sanitization.

## üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your machine:

# 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```
2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install all the necessary dependencies with npm:

```bash
npm install
This will install all the packages listed in the package.json file, including ajv, bcrypt, config, cookie-parser, ejs, express, helmet, jsonwebtoken, mongoose, validator, and others.
```

3. Set Up Configuration
This project uses the config package for configuration management. Create a default.json file in the config directory, and specify your configurations. Here's an example:

```bash
{
  "jwtsec": "yourSecretKey",
  "dbConfig": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 27017,
    "dbName": "yourDatabaseName"
  }
}
```
If you have environment-specific configurations, you can create files like production.json or development.json inside the config folder.

4. Running the Project
Once everything is set up, you can run the project with:

```bash
npm start
This command will start the server. By default, it listens on port 3000, but you can customize this in your configuration.
```
5. MongoDB Setup
Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your local machine or set up a MongoDB instance in the cloud. The connection details should match those specified in your config file under dbConfig.

6. Accessing the API
Now that your server is running, you can access the API at http://localhost:3000/.

7. Deploying the Project
To deploy this project, you can follow the Heroku Deployment Guide or any other platform of your choice.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development and Contributing
If you'd like to contribute, feel free to fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request. Contributions are always welcome!

8. Running Tests
If there are tests in the project, you can run them using:

bash
Copy code
npm test
This will execute all test cases and provide you with a report of the results.
